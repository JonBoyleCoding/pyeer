Finally, no matter your decision about contributing, we would like to welcome you to our community.

## Contributing

Please feel free of contributing in any of the following ways:

- Issues: If you detect a bug, an awkward behavior, a feature that you think may be presented in a better way or make the package easiest to use, we would deeply appreciate you bringing our attention to that by creating an issue. It is strongly recommended that the issues are documented as thoroughly as possible when created. Particularly, if you detect a bug, any details and information that you can provide in order to replicate the buggy behavior will be very helpful. Please, if you only have a doubt about the use of the package, do not create an issue, just write us an email and your questions will be answered as soon as possible.
